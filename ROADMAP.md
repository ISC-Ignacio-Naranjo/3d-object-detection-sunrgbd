## 📅 Week 1: Fundamentals + Environment Setup + Dataset Exploration

### 🎯 Goals
- Understand core 3D Object Detection concepts
- Set up the development environment
- Download and explore the SUN RGB-D dataset

### ✅ Tasks
- [ ] Install Python, Conda, PyTorch
- [ ] Install Open3D, Matplotlib, SciPy, NumPy
- [ ] Download SUN RGB-D dataset
- [ ] Load `.mat` annotation files with `scipy.io.loadmat`
- [ ] Visualize RGB images and depth maps
- [ ] Generate point clouds from depth
- [ ] Draw 3D bounding boxes

---

## 📅 Week 2: Modeling and Training

### 🎯 Goals
- Train a base model (VoteNet)
- Evaluate and visualize detection results

### ✅ Tasks
- [ ] Clone VoteNet repository
- [ ] Configure dataset preprocessing for SUN RGB-D
- [ ] Train VoteNet on SUN RGB-D
- [ ] Evaluate performance (mAP@0.25, IoU 3D)
- [ ] Visualize predicted bounding boxes vs. ground truth

## 📅 Week 3: Optimization + Analysis + Presentation

### 🎯 Goals
- Analyze and improve model results
- Prepare final deliverables

### ✅ Tasks
- [ ] Analyze performance by object class
- [ ] Identify failure cases and difficult scenes
- [ ] (Optional) Try RGB+Depth fusion or fine-tuning
- [ ] Prepare final slides/report
- [ ] Include visualizations and metrics
- [ ] Prepare project README and documentation

---

## 🎁 Final Deliverables

- [ ] Code repository (clean, documented)
